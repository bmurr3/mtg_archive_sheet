# Magic: the Gathering Archive

## Purpose

This tool is a local, simplified tool for people who like to view analytics about their Magic: the Gathering card collections. This is also a tool to allow for simple organization of one's cards. The main issue this tool attempts to solve is that other tools can overly complicate the card-entry system, especially when attempting to track specific variants of cards (esp. cards like Sol Ring, with dozens of print options). Card entry is streamlined to simply the following fields: Set Code, Collector Number, and Is It Foil.
